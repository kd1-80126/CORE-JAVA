/*
 * A company pays its employees on a weekly basis. The employees are of four
 * types: Salaried employees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the
 * number of hours worked. Hourly employees are paid by the hour and receive
 * overtime pay (i.e., 1.5 times their hourly salary rate) for all hours worked
 * in excess of 40 hours. Commission employees are paid a percentage of their
 * sales. Base-salaried commission employees receive a base salary plus a
 * percentage of their sales. For the current pay period, the company has
 * decided to reward salaried-commission employees by adding 10% to their base
 * salaries. The company wants to write an application that performs its payroll
 * calculations polymorphically.
